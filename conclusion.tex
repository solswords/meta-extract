{\it \color{red} One or both of us will write this.  Maybe we'll wait
  till a draft of the rest is written, so that we can hit the high
  points here.  Any ideas about future work?  Any lessons learned?
  (It would be cool if some application would likely have been much
  more difficult to carry out without this.)}
