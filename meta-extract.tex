{\it \color{red} MATT will write this:

\begin{enumerate}

\item example
\item summary of forms (we might need to discuss this)
\item rough sketch of correctness argument (point to Essay for
  details; maybe note, without going into it, that attachments present
  a complication, but need support (originally the restrictions were
  more draconian))

\end{enumerate}
}

% !! Maybe an example could be to simplify
% (equal (f1 v1) (f2 fv)) to nil when f1 and f2 both have bodies
% of the form (cons 'K ...) and the two K values differ.
% Think of (fi x) as "tagging" some function of x, where we have
% reason to leave each fi disabled, and some tags are re-used but
% others are not.

% MORE INTERESTING EXAMPLE could be nth-update, for example so that we can
% leave stobj accessors and updators disabled.  In this section we'd need
% meta-extract-global-fact for specific fns, but Sol's section could
% include an example showing how we only need one rule even for fns (and
% stobjs) not yet defined.
