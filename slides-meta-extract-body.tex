\section{\scshape Introduction}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item ACL2 supports rule classes {\tt :meta} and {\tt
    :clause-processor} that allow user-supplied extensions to the
  prover.

\item In this talk we'll focus on {\tt :meta} rules and corresponding
  {\em metafunctions}.

\item The {\em meta-extract} utilities (introduced in late 2012)
  permit correctness of metafunctions to depend on facts extracted
  from the {\em world} or the {\em context}.

\item This talk:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item reviews meta reasoning;

  \item gives two simple examples to illustrate meta-extract hypotheses;

  \item discusses a nice short-cut;

  \item summarizes some applications; and

  \item points to the paper and supporting materials for more information.

  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{\scshape Review of {\tt :Meta} Rules}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Review of {\tt :Meta} Rules}

Perhaps the earliest example of a {\tt :meta} rule is the function
\verb|cancel_plus-equal|, from
community book {\tt meta/meta-plus-equal}.

It cancels like terms from the equality of two sums.

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
ACL2 !>:trans (equal (+ x y x z) (+ x z z z))

(EQUAL (BINARY-+ X (BINARY-+ Y (BINARY-+ X Z)))
       (BINARY-+ X (BINARY-+ Z (BINARY-+ Z Z))))

=> *

ACL2 !>(cancel_plus-equal
        '(EQUAL (BINARY-+ X (BINARY-+ Y (BINARY-+ X Z)))
                (BINARY-+ X (BINARY-+ Z (BINARY-+ Z Z)))))
(EQUAL (BINARY-+ Y X) (BINARY-+ Z Z))
ACL2 !>
\end{verbatim}
}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Review of {\tt :Meta} Rules (2)}

These are the key events (eliding the definition of
\verb|cancel_plus-equal|).

\begin{verbatim}
(defevaluator ev-plus-equal ev-plus-equal-list
  ((binary-+ x y) (fix x) (equal x y)
   (acl2-numberp x) (if x y z)))

(defun cancel_plus-equal (x)
  (declare (xargs :guard (pseudo-termp x)))
  ...)

(defthm cancel_plus-equal-correct
  (equal (ev-plus-equal x a)
         (ev-plus-equal (cancel_plus-equal x) a))
  :rule-classes ((:meta :trigger-fns (equal))))
\end{verbatim}

Let's see this rule used in a proof.

\section{\scshape Example 1: Using Contexts}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Example 1: Using Contexts}

We will explain the following {\tt :meta} rule.

\begin{verbatim}
; workshops/2017/kaufmann-swords/support/intro.lisp
(defthm nth-symbolp-meta
  (implies (nthmeta-ev
            (meta-extract-contextual-fact
             `(:typeset ,(cadr term))
             mfc
             state)
            a)
           (equal (nthmeta-ev term
                              a)
                  (nthmeta-ev (nth-symbolp-metafn
                               term mfc state)
                              a)))
  :rule-classes ((:meta :trigger-fns (nth))))
\end{verbatim}

\end{frame}

\section{\scshape Example 2: Using Global Facts}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Example 2: Using Global Facts}

\begin{verbatim}
; demos/nth-update-nth-meta-extract.lisp
(defthm nth-update-nth-meta-rule-st
  (implies
   (and (nth-update-nth-ev ; (f (update-g val st))
         (meta-extract-global-fact
          (list :formula (car term)) state)
         (meta-extract-alist term a state))
        ...)
   (equal (nth-update-nth-ev term a)
          (nth-update-nth-ev
           (nth-update-nth-meta-fn term mfc state)
           a)))
  :hints ...
  :rule-classes ((:meta :trigger-fns ...)))
\end{verbatim}

\section{\scshape A Nice Short-cut}
\begin{frame}[fragile] {A Nice Short-cut}

The utility {\tt def-meta-extract}, which defines two
hypotheses that imply all contextual and global facts, respectively.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt (evl-meta-extract-contextual-facts a)}

\item {\tt (evl-meta-extract-ev-global-facts)}

\end{itemize}

This is provided by community book {\tt
  clause-processors/meta-extract-user.lisp}, thus minimizing the ACL2
trusted code base.

Here is an example showing the power of (one of) these hypotheses.

\begin{verbatim}
(defthm evl-meta-extract-formula
   (implies (and (evl-meta-extract-ev-global-facts)
                 (equal (w st) (w state)))
            (evl (meta-extract-formula name st) a)))
\end{verbatim}

\end{frame}

\section{\scshape Some Applications}
\begin{frame}[fragile] {Some Applications}

\begin{itemize}

\item The GL symbolic interpreter uses meta-extract hypotheses to
  call functions without additional proof obligations.

\item The community book {\tt centaur/misc/bound-rewriter.lisp}
  provides a tool for solving certain inequalities:

\item A meta rule for context-sensitive rewriting (like Greve's
  ``nary'' framework is defined in {\tt centaur/misc/context-rw.lisp}.

\item Others....

\end{itemize}

\section{\scshape Conclusion}
\begin{frame}[fragile] {Conclusion}

Some concluding thoughts....

\begin{itemize}

\item This talk is just an introduction; meta reasoning is a bit
  complex to absorb in real time!

\item The paper develops the ideas from this talk more thoroughly,
  with more illustrative examples.  See also: \\
  {\tt books/workshops/2017/kaufmann-swords/support/README}.

\item If you use GL then you are already taking advantage of
  meta-extract.
